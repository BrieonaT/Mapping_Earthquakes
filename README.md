# Summary

The purpose of this repository is to track data of earthquakes across the globe. In the Earthquakes_Challenge directory, you will find a map with multiple options to view earthquake data. Inside, you can look across the globe and display earthquakes, major earthquakes and tectonic plates and the magnitude of each and where they fall.
